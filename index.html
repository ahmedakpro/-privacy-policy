        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: August 21, 2024</p>

        <h2>Definitions and Interpretation</h2>
        <p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the following terms shall have the meanings specified below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"App"</strong> refers to the WorksPro Plus application.</li>
            <li><strong>"Personal Data"</strong> means any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual, such as a name, email address, or phone number. However, the App does not collect such data.</li>
            <li><strong>"Non-Personal Data"</strong> refers to data that is not linked to a specific individual, such as a device ID used to check if a device uses a Free Trial. This data does not include any information that identifies a user personally.</li>
            <li><strong>"Local Database"</strong> refers to the SQLite database used by the App to store your business information, documents, and settings on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>"Backup"</strong> refers to a copy of your data stored locally on your device or in a location chosen by you, which can be restored if needed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the above terms are implemented in the context of the App's functionality and your data privacy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>

        <h3>Personal Data:</h3>
        <p>WorksPro+ does not collect, store, or share any personal data of its users. The app does not require or access personal identifiers such as your name, email address, or phone number.</p>

        <h3>Non-Personal Data:</h3>
        <p>The app collects a device ID only to check if this device uses a Free Trial or not. We don't collect any data about the user or access their data or documents.</p>

        <h2>2. Database and Data Storage</h2>

        <p>WorksPro+ uses a local database (SQLite) to store your business information, documents, and settings. This data remains on your device and is not uploaded or shared with any third party or server.</p>

        <h3>Backup and Restore:</h3>
        <p>Users can back up and restore their data within the app. These backups are stored locally on your device or in a location chosen by you (e.g., external storage). We recommend you secure your backups appropriately.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>

        <p>All data created within WorksPro+, such as order lists, price offers, invoices, and reports, are stored locally on your device. This data is used solely for the purpose of providing app functionality and will not be used for any other purposes.</p>

        <h2>4. Documents Sharing</h2>

        <p>WorksPro+ allows you to share documents via PDF through various sharing services (e.g., Bluetooth, QuickShare, etc.). This sharing is initiated and controlled by you, the user, and the app does not track or store the data shared.</p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>

        <p>We are committed to protecting your documents. WorksPro Plus includes several security features, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>App Lock:</strong> You can secure the app with a password to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Password and Security Settings:</strong> You can change your password and set security questions to help recover access if needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, as the data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on the security measures you implement on your device.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>WorksPro+ does not use or integrate with any third-party services that collect personal data.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>
